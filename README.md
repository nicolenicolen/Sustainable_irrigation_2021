### Code and data for “Accounting for socioeconomic constraints in sustainable irrigation expansion assessments” (van Maanen et al., 2022) 

This repository contains the data and the code necessary to replicate the analysis of van Maanen et al. (2022). 
For any comments or questions about the contents of the repository, please address the corresponding author at nicole.vanmaanen@climateanalytics.org. 
If you find the code in this repository helpful please cite van Maanen et al. (2022). 

The script SIDI_2022.R provides the code for importing and wrangling the datasets used for specifying the statistical model and the datasets with the existing SSP projections of dependent variables later used for projecting the SIDI and the related variables. The script also includes code for the production of the figures. 
The folder “Socioeconomic_variables” includes the socioeconomic variables used in the statistical analysis. Please check the paper for references.
